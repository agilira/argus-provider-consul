## Security Testing and Fuzz Testing

### Overview

The Argus Consul Provider undergoes comprehensive security testing including static analysis, dynamic testing, and **fuzz testing** to identify potential vulnerabilities and ensure robust security in production environments.

### Fuzz Testing Implementation

This provider includes comprehensive fuzz testing implemented with Go's native fuzzing framework (Go 1.18+) to test critical security boundaries:

#### Fuzz Test Functions

1. **`FuzzParseConsulURL`** - Tests Consul URL parsing security
   - **Attack Surface**: URL parsing and validation
   - **Security Coverage**: SSRF prevention, authentication bypass detection, credential exposure prevention
   - **Seed Corpus**: Real-world attack vectors including path traversal, host manipulation, and protocol confusion

2. **`FuzzValidateSecureKeyPath`** - Tests path traversal prevention  
   - **Attack Surface**: Consul key path validation
   - **Security Coverage**: Directory traversal attacks, Windows device name exploitation, URL encoding bypass
   - **Seed Corpus**: Known path traversal patterns, Windows device names, encoded attacks

3. **`FuzzConsulJSONParsing`** - Tests JSON parser resilience
   - **Attack Surface**: JSON parsing from Consul responses
   - **Security Coverage**: Memory exhaustion prevention, parser DoS protection, malformed data handling
   - **Seed Corpus**: Oversized responses, deeply nested objects, malformed JSON

4. **`FuzzConsulLoad`** - Tests end-to-end Load function
   - **Attack Surface**: Complete configuration loading process
   - **Security Coverage**: Integrated security validation, error handling safety
   - **Seed Corpus**: Malicious URLs, invalid configurations, edge cases

### Running Fuzz Tests

#### Quick Fuzz Testing (30 seconds each test)
```bash
make fuzz
```

#### Extended Fuzz Testing (5 minutes each test - recommended for CI)
```bash 
make fuzz-extended
```

#### Continuous Fuzz Testing (until interrupted)
```bash
make fuzz-continuous
```

#### Security-Focused CI Pipeline
```bash
make ci-security  # Includes static analysis + fuzz testing
```

### Interpreting Fuzz Test Results

#### Successful Fuzz Run
```
fuzz: elapsed: 30s, gathering baseline coverage: 0s, corpus: 156 (now: 156), crashers: 0
```
- **No crashers**: All inputs handled safely
- **Corpus growth**: Fuzzer found new interesting inputs
- **Baseline coverage**: Code paths exercised

#### Fuzz Failure Indicators
```
fuzz: elapsed: 5s, gathering baseline coverage: 0s, corpus: 23 (now: 23), crashers: 1
```
- **crashers > 0**: Security vulnerability or crash found
- **Check testdata/fuzz/**: Contains failing inputs
- **Review crash logs**: Identify root cause

#### Security Invariant Violations
Look for these patterns in fuzz output:
- `SECURITY VIOLATION:` - Critical security boundary bypassed
- `SECURITY LEAK:` - Information disclosure detected  
- `PERFORMANCE WARNING:` - Potential DoS condition
- `RESOURCE VIOLATION:` - Memory/resource exhaustion

### Fuzz Test Security Coverage

#### URL Parsing Security (parseConsulURL)
- **SSRF Prevention**: Blocks connections to internal services (127.0.0.1:22, 169.254.169.254)
- **Authentication Bypass**: Prevents token/credential manipulation
- **Host Header Injection**: Validates host format and prevents confusion attacks
- **Protocol Confusion**: Enforces consul:// scheme requirement
- **Credential Exposure**: Ensures passwords/tokens don't leak in error messages

#### Path Validation Security (validateSecureKeyPath)
- **Directory Traversal**: Blocks ../, ..\, and URL-encoded variants
- **Windows Device Names**: Prevents CON, PRN, COM1, LPT1, etc. exploitation
- **Null Byte Injection**: Detects \x00 and control characters
- **Path Length Limits**: Enforces reasonable path size constraints
- **Normalization Attacks**: Handles complex encoding combinations

#### JSON Parser Security (JSON parsing)
- **Memory Exhaustion**: Limits response size and parsing time
- **Nested Object DoS**: Detects deeply nested JSON structures
- **Large Array DoS**: Handles oversized array responses
- **Malformed Data**: Gracefully handles invalid JSON
- **Control Character Injection**: Filters dangerous characters in keys/values

### Security Testing Best Practices

1. **Regular Execution**: Run fuzz tests in CI/CD pipeline for every commit
2. **Extended Testing**: Use `fuzz-extended` for security-critical releases  
3. **Continuous Monitoring**: Run `fuzz-continuous` during security audits
4. **Corpus Maintenance**: Review and update seed corpus with new attack vectors
5. **Failure Investigation**: Immediately investigate any fuzz failures or crashes

### Integration with Red Team Testing

Fuzz testing complements red team security analysis:
- **Static Analysis**: gosec, staticcheck for code-level vulnerabilities
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: govulncheck for known CVEs in dependencies
- **Dynamic Testing**: Fuzz testing for runtime behavior validation  
- **Red Team Testing**: Manual security assessment and penetration testing
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end security validation in realistic environments

### Continuous Security Improvement

The fuzz testing suite is continuously enhanced based on:
- **Security Research**: New attack vectors and techniques
- **Vulnerability Disclosures**: Real-world Consul security issues
- **Red Team Findings**: Results from security assessments
- **Community Contributions**: External security research and reports

For security issues found through fuzz testing or other means, please follow the vulnerability reporting process above.
